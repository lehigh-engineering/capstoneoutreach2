                    Lehigh's Computer Science Outreach Program aims to broaden Lehighâ€™s outreach to the wider Bethlehem community, addressing the gap in computer science education and compliance with STEELS standards by 2025.
                    With original stand-alone modules, we equip teachers of all levels with the resources to expose young students to core computer science concetps and spark an early interest in engineering.
