            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>The Computer Science Outreach Program involves collaboration with Lehigh University's P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and its outreach manager, Chayah Wilbers, to develop educational outreach assets aimed at sparking interest in computer science among late elementary, middle school, and high school students.</p>
            <p>Our goal was to broaden Lehigh's outreach to the wider Bethlehem community, addressing the gap in computer science education and compliance with STEELS standards by 2025.</p>
            <p>Our proposed solution was the creation of a website hosting computer science lessons with accompanying plans and activities. The lessons were made to be fun, easy to follow, and hopefully inspire students in the Bethlehem area.</p>
            <p>This project was made possible by Lehigh computer science students; Kyra Lee, Bernice Wong, Lara Flaten, and Jacob The Losen.</p>
