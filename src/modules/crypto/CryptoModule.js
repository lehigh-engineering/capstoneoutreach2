                <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Begin by asking students if they have heard of cryptography before. Discuss with them what they think it is, what it actually is, and why it is important.</p>
                    <p>A classroom example might be students secretly passing notes. Peers or teachers can intercept the note, it might be accidentally dropped or forgotten for anyone to pick up and read. An encrypted message will only read as gibberish if it falls into the wrong hands. Without the key possessed by the creator and recipient of the message, the cipher text holds no meaning.</p>
                <h2>Caesar Cipher</h2>
                    <p>Introduce the Caesar cipher as one of the oldest and simplest forms of encryption. Julius Caesar first used it to communicate with his generals on the battlefield so opposing generals couldnâ€™t decipher his plans.</p>
                    <p>To demo it, write the alphabet on the board. And right under it, write the alphabet again offset by a shift of 3 (Caesar used a shift of 3) such that the letters line up.</p>
                    <p><b>Example:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <p>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</p>
                            <p>DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC</p>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Below are some examples you can work through with the class.</p>

                    <p>Using the wheels, encourage the students to try going from plaintext to ciphertext and vice versa. Once they are familiar, you can try shifting by different amounts as well. Spin the wheel so the right letters of the inner and outer rings line up to match according to the shift and start deciphering!</p>
                    <p>But what happens if you don't know the key? Intuitively, we might begin to try all possible keys until we come upon the right one. Doing so, we employ a brute force approach. Allow students to attempt deciphering a few words without telling them the key! You may discuss the strategies stated below as well.</p>

                    <p><b>Hint:</b></p>
                    <p>When deciphering WITHOUT a key, a good idea is to look for common letters and match them with the most common letters in English words. Statistically this would be E, T, A. This method of analyzing the frequency of letters to aid in deciphering is called frequency analysis.</p>
                    <p>Another good idea is to look at stand alone letters or short words. A single letter is likely to be A or I, while two letter words may be is, am, etc.</p>

                    <p>Bring the class back together and have them share their decrypted messages (as applicable based on classroom activity). Discuss the strategies they employed and the challenges they faced during the activity.</p>
                    <p>Discuss real-world applications of cryptography and its role in cybersecurity. Encourage students to reflect on the role of cryptography in their own lives and why it is important. Where have they noticed it? Why do we need it? Do they see any problems (ethically/technologically), limitations, or alternatives? What is the impact it has had on technology and future implications?</p>
                    <p>In summary, cryptography is just one of the many tools used in cybersecurity and adds an extra layer of privacy and confidentiality that helps prevent data theft. Actual industry standards involve encryption algorithms far more complex than the Caesar cipher, notably AES and RSA. However, the underlying critical thinking and logical skills needed to use and create them are the same!</p>
