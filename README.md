# Lehigh COE Outreach Program
## Sponsor: Chayah Wilbers

## Project Team
- Kyra Lee
- Jacob The Losen
- Lara Flaten
- Bernice Wong
 
## Executive Summary 
This project involves collaboration with Lehigh’s P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and its outreach manager, Chayah Wilbers, to develop educational outreach assets aimed at sparking interest in computer science among late elementary, middle school, and high school students. The assets will consist of engaging lesson modules aligned with the computer science curriculum at Lehigh, incorporating Pennsylvania’s STEELS standards. Our goal is to broaden Lehigh’s outreach to the wider Bethlehem community, addressing the gap in computer science education and compliance with STEELS standards by 2025.
The proposed solution outlines the creation of a website hosting computer science lessons with accompanying plans and activities. The technical architecture includes HTML, CSS, and React for the front end, while Java and SQL will handle the back end, including user authentication. The project acknowledges limitations such as resource constraints, reliance on household materials for activities, and the necessity for at least one computer. The project will be developed using an Agile methodology, specifically SCRUM, organized into 1-week sprints with a total of 13 sprints planned for the semester. The schedule outlines key tasks for each sprint and a general framework of our progress. The risk management section addresses testing, security, and other potential challenges, along with how we plan to mitigate these issues. We will provide deliverables including artifacts and diagram mockups, module/lesson plans, and a website with user authentication to display the content.

## Business background 
We will be working with Lehigh’s P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Chayah Wilbers, its outreach manager, to build educational outreach assets intended to get late elementary, middle school, and high school students excited about the potential for the future study of computer science. These assets will take the form of lesson modules that engage in concepts from Lehigh students' computer science curriculum and will incorporate Pennsylvania’s new STEELS standards. Our modules will be accessible on a website we will create to be used by people from a variety of backgrounds. The lessons will be fun, easy to follow, and hopefully inspire students in the Bethlehem area.

## Current Solution 
Currently, Lehigh hosts the CHOICES outreach program which is targeted to middle school girls. There are also a variety of events to expose students to different technologies such as drones, virtual reality, and Spheros. However, we want to further extend the scope of Lehigh’s outreach into the wider Bethlehem community. Additionally, the curriculum of most schools within this area is not currently up to Pennsylvania’s STEELS standards that will be implemented by 2025. Due to a lack of funding and resources, many schools are currently unable to effectively teach a developed computer science curriculum. 

## Proposed Solution 
### Technical Architecture 
We will create a website to display different computer science lessons created by us, each with a lesson plan and an activity. 
The hosting technology of the website is TBD.
### Software Design Description (SDD) 
- Front end: create and maintain website, design website graphics
- Back end: user authentication
Lesson creator: devise basic computer science lessons to be followed by teachers with little CS background
### Development Architecture
- HTML (front end)
- CSS (front end)
- React (front end)
- Java (back end)
- SQL (back end)
### Exclusions and Limitations 
Lack of resources, especially technological ones make it hard to demonstrate actual computer science and limits the activities to ones using household materials.
Users of the modules have limited technological background, as a result, the modules must be kept relatively simple.
Our website/project requires the use of at least one computer, so it will not be suited for classrooms with no computer access.
### Business Value 
Students at Lehigh Valley schools will be the primary users of the application and they should benefit from the system by increasing their knowledge of CS.
Teachers will also be using the system, and they should benefit from access to supplementary curriculum.
School districts themselves should benefit from the application because it will help them to become compliant with Pennsylvania’s new STEELS standards for STEM education.
The Rossin College of Engineering will benefit from increase student exposure to Lehigh’s resources and the CHOICES program.

## Methodology and Schedule
### Methodology 
We will be using an Agile methodology, specifically SCRUM, to create this project.
Our work will be done in 1-week sprints with a total of 13 sprints this semester.
### Schedule
- Sprint 1 (2/2): Configure Jira and Confluence, create the project charter, set up weekly team and sponsor meetings.
- Sprint 2 (2/9): Complete the project charter draft.
- Sprint 3 (2/16): Design artifacts to outline the plan for our website.
- Sprint 4 (2/23): Create website and start creating modules.
- Sprint 5 (3/1): Upload modules to the website and continue to refine the website design.
Checkpoint presentation (3/5): Have a fully functioning website that displays a few modules, gain feedback and implement those suggestions.
- Sprint 6 (3/8): Continue to create and upload modules.
- Sprint 7 (3/22): Test website/modules in a classroom (table at Spring CHOICES)?
- Sprint 8 (3/29): Start implementing user authentication.
- Sprint 9 (4/5): Continue working on user authentication and integrating it with the website.
- Sprint 10 (4/12): Develop different features for teachers vs. students based on log in.
- Sprint 11 (4/19): Continue to develop different features for teachers vs. students based on log in.
- Sprint 12 (4/26): Finalize website features, test and review.
- Sprint 13 (5/3): Have a working website that displays lessons/modules with additional features such as user authentication.
